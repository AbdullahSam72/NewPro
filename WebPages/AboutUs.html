                  James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton initiated
                  the Java language project in June 1991.[23] Java was
                  originally designed for interactive television, but it was too
                  advanced for the digital cable television industry at the
                  time.[24] The language was initially called Oak a fter an oak
                  tree that stood outside Gosling's office. Later the project
                  went by the name Green and was finally renamed Java, from Java
                  coffee, the coffee from Indonesia.[25] Gosling designed Java
                  with a C/C++-style syntax that system and application
                  programmers would find familiar.[26]
